# Introduction

### Here's the context: 
A significant number of members of Generation Z actively propagate (as a joke or seriously) the myth that birds doesn't exist anymore, because they were gradually replaced by the government with drones. These drones perform, in this conspiracy theory, surveillance of the citizens. Our group studied how much bot activity contributes to the spread of conspiracy theories like these. The rise of social media (namely, Twitter) brought about the rapid development and circulation of misinformation, which are threats to public interests, safety, and security at times. We aim to analyze data collected from Twitter that discusses the well-known parody conspiracy theory - the Birds Aren't Real movement.

Twitter has suffered from unwelcome bot accounts and activity since its inception. To the untrained eye, they may appear as reliable accounts owned and ran by an actual human. The effects these bots have range from funny when easily noticed to outright dangerous, particularly if the bot is spreading believable disinformation. As a recent example of this, in May 2020 a group of researchers conducted a [study](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/20/859814085/researchers-nearly-half-of-accounts-tweeting-about-coronavirus-are-likely-bots) and discovered that up to 45% of COVID-19 related tweets were from accounts that behaved like bots. These bot accounts were spreading vast amounts of disinformation that had real-world consequences. The risk these bots pose for maintaining the spread of accurate information cannot be understated; as such, researching the frequency of bot posts on various "hot topics" is critical to ensuring that the average post about those topics is accurate and reliable.

On a significantly more light-hearted topic than COVID-19, the "Birds Aren't Real" conspiracy theory claims that the U.S. government has gradually replaced birds with drone mimics, which are used by the NSA (or another government agency, depending on the theorist) to conduct surveillance on U.S. citizens. The primary goal of this study is to identify the percentage of posts related to the "Birds Aren't Real" conspiracy that are posted by bot accounts. The resulting percentage could be telling of the presence of disinformation-spreading bots on Twitter as a whole. Additional points of research include any potential location trends and date trends - that is, when the conspiracy theory had a stronger/weaker presence online.

The Birds Aren’t Real parody conspiracy theory highlights the prevalence of Twitter bot misinformation in a world where data is abundant, but not regulated for accuracy. Studying this dataset may give further clarity as to why unsubstantiated theories pervade our mainstream media, its misinformation directly causing violence, political polarization, and brainwashing. Occurrences of misinformation from Twitter bot activity reflect the need to continuously monitor the spread of false, unreliable misinformation. Data from the Birds Aren’t Real conspiracy theory is crucial to understand how Twitter bot activity contributes directly to the dissemination of ungrounded conspiracy theories and associated misinformation.

The main ethical concern was that we were required to make an account to download this data, rather than it being completely free and open to use. That's a possible concern as it should be available to anyone, even if they don't have an email. Some limitations to this data are the fact that, due to its artificial and satirical nature, the intent behind making a bot dedicated to Birds Aren't Real is likely to deviate from the 'traditional' motivation for making bots that spread untested information unchecked. This may or may not affect the amount of bot activities regarding Birds Aren't Real. It is true that Birds Aren't Real reflects many aspects of actual conspiracy theories and their expansion. However, there is little room for it to be considered political, while a lot of conspiracy theories are prone to being politically interpreted or based on politics. Such cases may or may not display a different bot situation compared to Birds Aren't Real.

# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways

### In Conclusion:

The Birds Aren’t Real parody conspiracy theory highlights the prevalence of Twitter bot misinformation in a world where data is abundant, but not regulated for accuracy. Our Twitter data analysis demonstrates how Twitter may act as an echo chamber in terms of spreading conspiracy theories or circulating disinformation. We have also learned that there are instances where individual or bot activities almost never gain traction, however, the sheer number of tweets and their exposure is influential to Twitter users.

### Takeaways:

Our first chart, which displays the popularity of the Birds Aren't Real movement on Twitter over the last two months, shows two distinct spikes in Birds Aren’t Real-Related Tweets. Rather than this chart showing a consistent distribution of Birds Aren’t Real-Related Tweets, it shows one spike between December 10th and the 27th, 2021 and a second between January 5th and the 26th, 2022. Between December 27th and January 5th, there were no Birds Aren’t Real-Related tweets counted. This chart demonstrates how the Birds Aren’t Real discourse is spread rapidly on Twitter within a matter of weeks and disperse even quicker. In this way, Twitter mimics an echo chamber system, sustaining the spread of disinformation within a concentrated timeframe.

Our second chart, which displays the outreach of the Birds Aren't Real movement on Twitter by showing how many posts have more than one retweet, shows how few of the posts involving the movement went viral on Twitter. According to this chart, the majority of Birds Aren’t Real-Related tweets received less than 10 retweets, and the greatest number of tweets received the minimum, 2 retweets. This indicates that the tweets are receiving engagement from a large audience, meaning that the tweets are not reaching a large number of users.

The third chart, which displays the top twenty self-proclaimed locations of users that tweeted about the Birds Aren't Real movement, demonstrates how there is a somewhat even distribution of tweet hot spot locations throughout the United States, particularly in urban areas with large populations like Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. This insight suggests that discourse regarding this movement is not limited geographically but disseminates through limited digital spaces instead.

Although we found that these tweets are not retweeted heavily or limited to one geographic location, our first chart’s findings demonstrate the nature in which controversial tweets related to Birds Not Real can become disseminated within a matter of days. This suggests that Twitter may be providing an environment where beliefs are amplified through reinforced, repetitive discourse isolated from opposing opinion. The implications of these findings are grave considering other unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that pervade our mainstream media, its misinformation potentially leading to violence, political polarization, and brainwashing. These occurrences of misinformation from Twitter bot activity reflect the need to continuously monitor the spread of false, unreliable misinformation.
