# Introduction

### Here's the context: 
A significant number of members of Generation Z actively propagate (as a joke or seriously) the myth that birds doesn't exist anymore, because they were gradually replaced by the government with drones. These drones perform, in this conspiracy theory, surveillance of the citizens. Our group studied how much bot activity contributes to the spread of conspiracy theories like these. The rise of social media (namely, Twitter) brought about the rapid development and circulation of misinformation, which are threats to public interests, safety, and security at times. We aim to analyze data collected from Twitter that discusses the well-known parody conspiracy theory - the Birds Aren't Real movement.

Twitter has suffered from unwelcome bot accounts and activity since its inception. To the untrained eye, they may appear as reliable accounts owned and ran by an actual human. The effects these bots have range from funny when easily noticed to outright dangerous, particularly if the bot is spreading believable disinformation. As a recent example of this, in May 2020 a group of researchers conducted a [study](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/20/859814085/researchers-nearly-half-of-accounts-tweeting-about-coronavirus-are-likely-bots) and discovered that up to 45% of COVID-19 related tweets were from accounts that behaved like bots. These bot accounts were spreading vast amounts of disinformation that had real-world consequences. The risk these bots pose for maintaining the spread of accurate information cannot be understated; as such, researching the frequency of bot posts on various "hot topics" is critical to ensuring that the average post about those topics is accurate and reliable.

On a significantly more light-hearted topic than COVID-19, the "Birds Aren't Real" conspiracy theory claims that the U.S. government has gradually replaced birds with drone mimics, which are used by the NSA (or another government agency, depending on the theorist) to conduct surveillance on U.S. citizens. The primary goal of this study is to identify the percentage of posts related to the "Birds Aren't Real" conspiracy that are posted by bot accounts. The resulting percentage could be telling of the presence of disinformation-spreading bots on Twitter as a whole. Additional points of research include any potential location trends and date trends - that is, when the conspiracy theory had a stronger/weaker presence online.

The Birds Aren’t Real parody conspiracy theory highlights the prevalence of Twitter bot misinformation in a world where data is abundant, but not regulated for accuracy. Studying this dataset may give further clarity as to why unsubstantiated theories pervade our mainstream media, its misinformation directly causing violence, political polarization, and brainwashing. Occurrences of misinformation from Twitter bot activity reflect the need to continuously monitor the spread of false, unreliable misinformation. Data from the Birds Aren’t Real conspiracy theory is crucial to understand how Twitter bot activity contributes directly to the dissemination of ungrounded conspiracy theories and associated misinformation.

The main ethical concern was that we were required to make an account to download this data, rather than it being completely free and open to use. That's a possible concern as it should be available to anyone, even if they don't have an email. Some limitations to this data are the fact that, due to its artificial and satirical nature, the intent behind making a bot dedicated to Birds Aren't Real is likely to deviate from the 'traditional' motivation for making bots that spread untested information unchecked. This may or may not affect the amount of bot activities regarding Birds Aren't Real. It is true that Birds Aren't Real reflects many aspects of actual conspiracy theories and their expansion. However, there is little room for it to be considered political, while a lot of conspiracy theories are prone to being politically interpreted or based on politics. Such cases may or may not display a different bot situation compared to Birds Aren't Real.
